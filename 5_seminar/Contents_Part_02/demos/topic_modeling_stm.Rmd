## Modeling topics with an STM

This demo is about **topic modeling with a structural topic model (STM)**.

We show how to prepare the data for fitting an STM ([Roberts et al., 2016](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/bstewart/files/a_model_of_text_for_experimentation_in_the_social_sciences.pdf)), conduct the modeling process, and analyze the results.


```{r setup_packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load required packages

library("data.table")
library("ggplot2")
library("quanteda")
library("stm")
```

### Create `dfm` object

As in the static feature extraction demo, we convert our data to a `dfm`. 
However, we focus on slightly different tokens this time as we are now interested in identifying topical relations.

First, we get the **data** (the `path` variable again requiring individual adaptation):

```{r path, include = FALSE}
path <- "5_seminar"
```


```{r read}

# path <- ... (individual file location)

twitter_corpus <- readRDS(sprintf("%s/twitter_corpus.RDS", path))

twitter_corpus

```

We furthermore store the document texts in the docvars (which poses a redundancy in the `corpus` object but ensures the texts are not lost during conversion for the `dfm`).

```{r text}

quanteda::docvars(twitter_corpus)$text <- quanteda::texts(twitter_corpus)

```

Now let's **tokenize** our corpus in a way appropriate for topic modeling. 

We assume that topical information is mostly carried by nouns and choose to remove all other words for document representation, attempting to eliminate noise that might distract our topic model.
This is, of course, a simplification, but that's life (of an analyst). 

Luckily, nouns are pretty easy to identify by their leading capital letters in German (implicitly relying on MPs' grammar skills and/or auto-correct, and accepting that this will also include non-nouns from the beginning of a sentence):

```{r tokenize}

# First, tokenize as usual

twitter_tokens <- quanteda::tokens(
  twitter_corpus,
  what = "word",
  remove_symbols = TRUE,
  remove_numbers = TRUE,
  remove_separators = TRUE,
  split_hyphens = TRUE,
  include_docvars = TRUE)

```

```{r stem}

# Stem

twitter_tokens <- quanteda::tokens_wordstem(
  twitter_tokens, 
  language = "german")

```

```{r keep}

# Keep only tokens starting with a capital letter

twitter_tokens <- quanteda::tokens_keep(
  twitter_tokens,
  pattern = c("[:upper:]([:lower:])+"),
  valuetype = "regex",
  case_insensitive = FALSE)

# Lowercase afterwards

twitter_tokens <- quanteda::tokens_tolower(twitter_tokens)

```

```{r clean_stem, include=FALSE}

clean_and_stem <- function(text) {
  
  # Convert to uniform encoding
  
  text <-  stringi::stri_trans_general(text, "Any-Latin")
  
  # Replace umlauts and litigate s
  
  text <- stringr::str_replace_all(
    text,
      c("\u00c4" = "Ae",
      "\u00e4" = "ae",
      "\u00d6" = "Oe",
      "\u00f6" = "oe",
      "\u00dc" = "Ue",
      "\u00fc" = "ue",
      "\u00df" = "ss"))
  
  # Stem
  
  text <- SnowballC::wordStem(text)
  
  unique(text)

}

clean_and_stem(c("DÃ¶ner", "Bereicherung", "kulinarischer", "Angebote"))

```

For stopwords removal we retrace the steps taken in the static feature extraction:

```{r stopwords}

# Remove stopwords using our cleaning function from earlier

stopwords <- clean_and_stem(quanteda::stopwords(language = "de"))
stopwords <- stopwords[nchar(stopwords) > 0]
stopwords <- stringr::str_remove_all(
  stopwords,
  "kein(.)*|nicht")
stopwords <- c(
  stopwords, 
  c("der", "die", "das", "was", "wer", "wie", "ich", "sie", "wir", "ihr"))

twitter_tokens <- quanteda::tokens_remove(
  twitter_tokens,
  pattern = stopwords)

twitter_tokens <- quanteda::tokens_select(twitter_tokens, min_nchar = 3)

# Inspect

twitter_tokens

```

Looking good, so convert to `dfm`:

```{r dfm}

twitter_dfm <- quanteda::dfm(twitter_tokens)

twitter_dfm

```

Unfortunately, as the above output tells us, our `dfm` is extremely **sparse** -- tokens are not at all common across documents, which will pose a challenge to any topic model.
This is actually not too surprising when we recall the extreme brevity of our Twitter documents.

*Side note*: if you run into this problem you might want to consider the option of pooling texts into larger documents (this can be achieved, for instance, calling `quanteda::dfm_group`).
However, this is obviously a heavy simplification and leads to all documents that share the same grouping variable being assigned the same topic label.

What we will do to alleviate the sparsity problem at least to some extent is to condense the `dfm` to the most prominent features: 

<!-- Therefore, we make another simplifying concession: we **pool** documents to create larger entities that should share more common tokens. -->

<!-- In this demo, we pool very coarsely and concatenate all tweets by one user to a single document. -->
<!-- Of course, it is not terribly plausible to assume users sticking to exactly one topic, but our toy data here are somewhat limited. -->

<!-- In a real application you would try and find a more suitable way of pooling documents, e.g., taking into account the date of creation (and probably do it as little as possible). -->

<!-- Using the pooling variable, we can reshape the `dfm` by **grouping** it: -->

```{r condense}

# Eliminate less common features

twitter_dfm <- quanteda::dfm_select(
  twitter_dfm,
  names(quanteda::topfeatures(twitter_dfm, n = 300)))

twitter_dfm

```

### Create prevalence formula

The special trait of the STM is its making use of s document-level **meta data**, so we need to specify which information to use here. In the `stm` function the corresponding argument is called `prevalence` and must be stated as a formula.

We will use the following meta variables (smooth effects defaulting to B-splines):

* `party` as a categorical variable
* `bundesland` as a categorical variable
* `unemployment_rate` as a smooth effect with 5 degrees of freedom
* `share_pop_migration` as a smooth effect with 5 degrees of freedom

The resulting formula, `~ party + bundesland + s(unemployment_rate, df = 5) + s(share_pop_migration, df = 5)`, is perfectly disputable -- this decision is up to domain knowledge and some trial-and-error, and we do not claim to use the ideal formula in this demo.

```{r prevalence}

prevalence_formula <- as.formula(paste(
  "", 
  "party + bundesland + s(unemployment_rate, df = 5) + s(share_pop_migration, df = 5)", 
  sep = "~"))

```

Now we have one thing to pay attention to: the `stm` implementation cannot handle **missing data** in its prevalence variables.
We must therefore exclude non-complete observations (alternatively, we could impute the missing values if it made sense and we had a meaningful imputation mechanism):

```{r missings}

twitter_dfm <- quanteda::dfm_subset(
  twitter_dfm,
  !is.na(party) & !is.na(bundesland) & !is.na(unemployment_rate) &
    !is.na(share_pop_migration))

twitter_dfm

```

### Create `stm` object

We then convert our `dfm` to an `stm` object we can use in the structural topic model.
This is super simple with `quanteda`:

```{r stm, warning=FALSE}

twitter_stm <- quanteda::convert(twitter_dfm, to = "stm")

summary(twitter_stm)

```

### Fit STM

Time to fit the actual **model**.

While models learn all necessary *parameters* during training, *hyperparameters* need to be specified upfront.
The most critical hyperparameter here is the number of topics, *K*. 
So how to find *K*?

Topic modeling being an unsupervised task (i.e., we do not have access to the ground truth), the quality of model output must ultimately be judged by human interpretability.
We can seek some help from the data: `stm` offers a function that searches for the optimal *K* (still requiring a range of potential values!).
Exactly what optimal means can be somewhat steered by the user.
We will use the *held-out likelihood* option which creates an artificial supervised task: we mask a certain part of some of the documents and ask the model to complete them (note that the ground truth is known now).
The more predictive power our model has, the higher the likelihood for the held-out words should be (for details see [Wallach et al., 2009](http://dirichlet.net/pdf/wallach09evaluation.pdf):

```{r searchk, results='hide'}

# Conduct hyperparameter search

hyperparameter_search <- stm::searchK(
  documents = twitter_stm$documents,
  vocab = twitter_stm$vocab,
  data = twitter_stm$meta,
  K = c(3:10),
  prevalence = prevalence_formula,
  heldout.seed = 1, # seed for reproducibility
  max.em.its = 5, # number of iterations
  init.type = "Spectral")

```

```{r findk}

# Fix optimal number of topics

(n_topics <- as.numeric(hyperparameter_search$results[
  which.max(hyperparameter_search$results[, "heldout"]), "K"]))

```

Seems `r toString(n_topics)` topics are a good choice, so let's fit the actual **model** now:

```{r fitstm, results='hide'}

# Fit STM

topic_model <- stm::stm(
    documents = twitter_stm$documents,
    vocab = twitter_stm$vocab,
    data = twitter_stm$meta,
    K = n_topics,
    prevalence = prevalence_formula,
    gamma.prior = "L1",
    seed = 1,
    max.em.its = 15,
    init.type = "Spectral")

```

### Interpret results

The tricky thing about unsupervised topic modeling is the **interpretation** part.
Statistical computations yield the results that best fit the data according to model assumptions but whether the found topics are considered meaningful is up to the human analyst.

Let's see whether we can make any sense of the model output by

* inspecting the most characteristic words for each topic,
* printing the most representative document for a given topic, and
* generating a variety of visualizations.

For one, we can call `stm`'s `labelTopics` function which returns the top terms per topic according to different metrics (for details, best check the function documentation):

* Highest probability: which words are most likely to occur in a document of the given topic?
* FREX: which words occur both frequently and exclusively, i.e., serve to characterize and distinguish topics? 
* Lift: which words occur most frequently if weighted by the inverse of their relative empirical frequency across the entire corpus?
* Score: which words show the largest difference between their (log) frequency in topic *k* and their average (log) frequency across all topics?

The `n` argument allows to specify how many words should be displayed. 
We go for 10:

```{r fitstm_2}

# Inspect results

(result_topic_modeling <- stm::labelTopics(topic_model, n = 10))

```

We can also access the word lists directly if we are particularly interested in results w.r.t a specific metric:

```{r fitstm_3}

t(result_topic_modeling$frex)

```

NB: Our results here are not very glorious.
We have already seen the extreme sparsity of the `dfm`, and with documents that are pretty dissimilar a topic model can only do so much.
This is also a consequence of our training data design: we have labels for relatively few, extremely short documents from a bunch of different authors.
In reality, scraping gives us access to much larger amounts of data.

So, consider this a technical demo, the interpretation part cannot be showcased very well anyway -- we just pretend to find a lot of meaning in the topics output by our STM.

Next, let's take another look at our topics by a more visually appealing means: 

```{r int}

plot(topic_model, type = "summary")

```

We can also plot **word clouds** displaying the most prominent words per topic (size indicating the probability of a word occurring in a document of the given topic):

```{r int_2}

invisible(lapply(seq_len(n_topics), function(i) stm::cloud(topic_model, topic = i)))

```

Finally, let's see the most representative documents for each topic, i.e., the tweets with the highest topic probability:

```{r int_3}

lapply(seq_len(n_topics), function(i) {
  stm::findThoughts(
    model = topic_model,
    texts = twitter_stm$meta$text,
    topics = i,
    n = 2)$docs[[1]]})

```

Using this visual support (and probably playing around with, e.g., the number of features to include in the `dfm` and the number of topics) we would now try to give our topic some decent names.

### Assign documents to topics

So `stm` has thrown a lot of words at us from which we are hopefully able to infer meaningful topics, but which documents actually belong to which topic? 
The model output provides us with a vector of topic probabilities for each document, meaning we can **label** the tweets by picking the topic for which they have the highest respective probability:

```{r assigntopics}

# Extract topic probabilities together with topic IDs and discard docnum

topic_probs <- stm::make.dt(topic_model)[
  , doc_id := names(twitter_stm$documents)
  ][, docnum := NULL]

topic_probs[sample(topic_probs[, .I], 5)]

```

```{r assigntopics_2}

# Get topic with highest score per document

topic_cols <- names(topic_probs)[startsWith(names(topic_probs), "Topic")]

topic_probs[
  , `:=` (
    max_topic_score = max(.SD, na.rm = TRUE),
    topic_label = which.max(.SD)),
  .SDcols = topic_cols,
  by = doc_id]

topic_probs[sample(topic_probs[, .I], 5)]

```

For mapping the topic labels back to the original tweets append them to the docvars...

```{r assigntopics_3}

# Extract docvars

twitter_docvars <- data.table::as.data.table(
  cbind(
    doc_id = quanteda::docid(twitter_corpus),
    quanteda::docvars(twitter_corpus)), 
  key = "doc_id")

# Append topic labels and remove irrelevant columns

twitter_docvars <- topic_probs[
  twitter_docvars, on = "doc_id"
    ][, c(topic_cols) := NULL]

twitter_docvars[sample(twitter_docvars[, .I], 5)]

```

...and, lastly, feed this information back into the original corpus object to save it for further usage:

```{r assigntopics_4}

# Insert info back into corpus

quanteda::docvars(twitter_corpus) <- as.data.frame(twitter_docvars)

```

**So that's how to model topics with an `stm`! Even though our training corpus is not easily clustered into topics, you hopefully got some idea how to handle this process code-wise. And then, we just do not always get lucky with such tasks in a sense that they can be expected to produce meaningful output all the time** Â¯|_(ã)_/Â¯
