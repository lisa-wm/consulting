## Some remarks
```{r, include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}

```

* The world's largest companies are investing heavily in NLP:  
  Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, ...
* But still: a lot of (yet) unsolved problems and challenges
* Innovations are more and more open-sourced
* There's a variety of different applications of NLP  
  in everyday life you might not be aware of
* Once you see them, it soon becomes obvious

## Neural Machine Translation

\end{figure}

* Two different NLP tasks are hiding in this picture..
* __Underlying task__: Text generation

## A brief History of Machine Translation

* __Rule-Based Machine Translation__ (50s -- 80s)
    + Dictionaries + Grammatical Rules
* __Example-Based Machine Translation__ (80s -- 90s)
    + First suggested by Makoto Nagao (1984)
    + Based on bilingual text corpora
* __Statistical Machine Translation__ (90s -- 10s)
    + Driven by IBM guys
* __Neural Machine Translation__ (last few years)
    + Based on neural networks (LSTMs, Transformers)

## Auto Completion

\end{figure}

* You might also know this from your smartphone keyboard
* __Underlying task__: Predict the next word given the previous words (+ individual browsing history)

## Spam filters

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

* Indeed, spam filters are often surprisingly simple systems
* __Underlying task__: Document classification (Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression)

## Argument Mining

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
 
* Detection and ranking of arguments pro/contra a certain topic
*  __Underlying task__: Document classification and/or Sequence tagging

## Chatbots

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 9cm]{`r ap("chatbots_small.png")`}
\end{figure}

* We experience chatbots on a growing number of websites
* __Underlying task__: Natural language understanding / Text generation
 
## Information Retrieval
 
 <center>
 
 *Alexa, what is the capital of Australia?*  
 
 </center>
 
* __Underlying task__: Question Answering / Information extraction
 
## (Some) Further examples

* __Sentiment analysis__ / __Text classification__
    + Determine, whether a document is positive/neutral/negative
* __Text Generation__
    + Example: [*OpenAI GPT2*](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/)
* __Named Entity Recognition__
    + Search for certain entities (e.g. person, location, etc.)
* __Image Captioning__
    + Hybrid task (Computer Vision + NLP)
* __Dependency Parsing__
    + Determine the grammatical structure of text
* __Part-of-speech tagging__
    + Tagging words according to their role in a text
