joint sentiment-topic modeling
- ngyuen & shirai (2015): topic modeling based sentiment analysis on social media for stock market prediction
  https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P15-1131.pdf
  --> proposition, but no explicit argument why s & t are modeled jointly
- mei et al. (2007) topi sentiment mixture
  --> rather for topics within one document (absa style)

two-step modeling
- bansal & srivastava (2018): predicting election with hybrid topic based sentiment analysis of tweets
  --> improvement of lexicon-based approaches: do not use simple avg of sentiment scores but weighted by sentiment-labeled topic proportions
  --> no argumentation why two-step approach
