Role: student

Text for intention:

I need the data in a project for my Master's degree in Statistics at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, more precisely, for the course in 
Statistical Consulting chaired by Prof. Dr. Helmut Küchenhoff. Together with a fellow student, we plan to analyze tweets by German MPs on specific 
policy issues. The data shall be processed by means of sentiment analysis methods.

I will analyze tweets by German MPs on specific policy issues with the goal of retrieving sentiment on each of these issues. Tweets shall be analzyed 
by means of machine learning methods in order to classify them as positive or negative attitude towards the aforementioned issues (such as covid-19 or 
environmental policy). All analyses are aimed at refining statistical methods of sentiment analysis and are carried out for a purely academical purpose, 
with no monetary aspect whatsoever.

I plan to use Tweet functionality only. Since the analysis focuses on sentiment expressed by text, original tweets are of interest, but inter-user 
interactions, such as likes, are not.

I will only use aggregate data in a processed form. For my analysis, only textual content is of interest, and text will not appear in its raw form.
