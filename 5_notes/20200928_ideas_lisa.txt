GENERAL ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Overall goal. Contribute to SA methodology with special focus on 
  - Political actors
  - Twitter
  - Sentiments on specific policy issues
  - Sentiments toward fellow politicians

METHODOLOGY ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Basic method. ML vs dictionary-based
  - ML requires labeled texts
  - Dictionary-based requires dictionary

  --> Both harder for German, probably

- What kind of learner do we need?!
  - Can we even perform supervised learning?!
  - Do we need to label data by hand, then?
  - We could use unsupervised, weakly supervised, or supervised methods

- General appraoch to classification problem w/ SUPERVISED methods.
  1. Pre-processing (tokenization, stop words removal, ...)
  2. Feature extraction
  3. Training of different learners
  4. Evaluation (precision, recall, ...)

- Response type
  - Binary?
  - Including neutral sentiment, or even more discrete, ordinary levels?
  - Probabilistic between binary poles?
  - Multi-class (different emotions, e.g., anger, sadness, satisfaction, ...)

- Features
  - Term frequencies
  - tdf-idf (term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency)
  - Unigrams, bigrams, trigrams

- Learners
  - SVM
  - Logistic regression
  - Trees / forests
  - Networks

- Agarwal et al. (2011). Value of features that combine polarity of words w/ parts-of-speech tags

- Approach toward specific issues
  - Either aspect-based SA, i.e., evaluate sentiment toward multiple aspects within one tweet
  - Or use topic analysis (project I?!) to assign topics to tweets and perform SA on entire tweet
  - Or just use hashtags?!
  - In any case, dictionaries (if used) may need to be adapted / appended (topic-specific vocabulary)
  - If ABSA: identify words loading on an aspect (e.g., those in a sentence identified to be about the aspect), calculate word-level sentiment,
    then aggregate to aspect-level sentiment

- Sentiment toward peers
  - Just use tweets where politicians have been tagged?
  - Or do we need some more sophisticated approach, like a network analysis to identify interesting relationships?

- Confounding / additional variables
  - Do we need to control for factors like frequency of tweeting?
  - Do SA models include typical controlling variables like sex?
  - Does it make sense to include variables like party affiliation or ideological position?
  - Are semantic characteristics (like use of capital letters or exclamation marks, sentence length) important?
  
  --> Additional variables might help both to avoid confounding and to support sentiment classification

TWITTER-RELATED --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- What aspects will we use?
  - Only tweets as plain text?
  - Also emojis, hashtags, comments..? (emojis might require dictionary of their own)

LANGUAGE ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Tweets all in German?!
- What about anglicisms?
- How can we ensure that our training data include domain-specific vocabulary / acronyms?
- How do we deal w/ spelling mistakes?
